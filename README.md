This repository contains the analytic code and data processing pipelines used in the study "Ten-year population-based assessment of multimorbidity burden progression in a regional cohort of 5.5 million adults". The study investigates multimorbidity progression using longitudinal population-wide electronic health records, develops predictive models for transition to high clinical complexity, and constructs directed disease co-occurrence networks for the most prevalent chronic conditions.
