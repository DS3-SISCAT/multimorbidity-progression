## Network explorer

To facilitate interactive exploration of the disease co-occurrence networks presented in the manuscript, we provide two complementary Shiny applications. These tools allow users to inspect network structure, node and edge attributes, and temporal patterns underlying multimorbidity progression.

- **Global disease network**  
  An interactive visualisation of the overall disease co-occurrence network, providing a population-level view of multimorbidity structure and dominant disease trajectories. Users can dynamically configure how the network is displayed, including the number of primary and secondary connections shown, enabling customised exploration of disease associations and network complexity.  
[Open the global disease network explorer](https://dvalero.shinyapps.io/multimorbidity_disease_network)

- **Disease-centred networks**  
  Interactive exploration of disease-centred directed networks, each focused on one of the most prevalent chronic conditions. Users can examine secondary and tertiary conditions, edge directionality (temporal ordering), and whether associations predominantly occur before or after transition to high multimorbidity burden (AMG ≥ P80).

These applications are intended as exploratory and hypothesis-generating tools that complement the static figures included in the manuscript and supplementary materials.

⚠️ *Note:* The interactive web application is provided as a research exploration tool and may change over time.  
This GitHub repository serves as the stable entry point referenced in the manuscript.
